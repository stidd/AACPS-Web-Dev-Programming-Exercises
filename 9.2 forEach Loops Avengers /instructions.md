## 08.2 forEach Loops Avengers: Curriculum War

**Students of AACPS** The universe needs your help! Use your knowledge of `forEach` loops to summon the galaxy's mightiest heroes to fight off the villainous Thanos and his quest to conquer your future!

#### INSTRUCTIONS

Inside the provided `click` handler, write a `forEach` loop that will iterate over the `avengerPics` array and display each image. (start your code on `line 13`)

#### CHALLENGE 1:

Add additional images to the `avengerPics` array of your favorite superhero! Does the image display without modifying any of the `forEach` loops?

#### CHALLENGE 2:

Create a new array called `avengerNames` with the names of the Avengers and create a new `forEach` loop to iterate over that array and display each name.
