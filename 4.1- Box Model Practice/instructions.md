We learned about four components of the **box model** today: margin, border, padding, and content. Make the "Questions" look like the "Answers"

1. Under the selector for `question-two`, write the CSS rule to make it match the "Answers" side.
2. Continue for all six questions.

If some of the boxes don't look right, maximize the window or minimize the HTML, JS and CSS panels

_Question 4 Hint: There are different types of borders, not only_ `solid`

_Question 5 Hint: There is another type of border. Use a border width greater than 2px_

## Done early?

- Make a grooved border around one of your answers (Google it!)
- Can you make the edges rounded? Google how to use CSS to make rounded edges on your boxes.
