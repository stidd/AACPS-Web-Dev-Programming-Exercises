Your school needs a site to keep track of scores during basketball games! Create the following variables to complete the site. Think carefully about whether these should be strings or numbers.

1. Declare two variables. One should be called teamOneName and the other should be called teamTwoName. Assign them both a value with the name of your teams.
2. Declare two more variables - scoreOne and scoreTwo. Assign them a starting value of zero.
3. Declare a variable freeThrow. Assign it a value of one - this is how many points will be added to the score when the free throw button is clicked.
4. Declare a variable twoPointShot. Assign it a value of two - this is how many points will be added to the score when the two point button is clicked.
5. Declare a variable threePointShot. Assign it a value of three - this is how many points will be added to the score when the three point button is clicked.

### Done early?

Declare a new variable called arena. Give it a value. Update the page to display the name of the arena above the team names.

Update the score so team two starts at 3 points.

Update the updateScore function so it SUBTRACTS points every time a button is clicked instead of adding.
