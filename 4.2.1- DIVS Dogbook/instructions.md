Congratulations! You've just been hired to help DogBook add some sorely needed structure to their website. Here's what needs to be done:

1. Nest the `h1` in a `div` with class `header`.
2. Nest the **last** `p` in a `div` with class `footer`.
3. Nest the **first** `h3` _and_ `ul` in a `div` with class `menu`.
4. Nest the **second** `h3` _and_ `ul` in a `div` with class `park`.
5. Nest the `menu` and `park` `div`s inside _another_ `div` with class `main`.

Don't forget to use indentation to make the nesting levels of your HTML elements _**obvious**_.

## Done early?

Next on DogBook's product roadmap is to add a **"Friends"** section. Add that section under the `main` section. It should show the top 8 dog friends. Each dog friend should include a picture and the dog friend's name.
