Carlton is having a hard time deciding what to wear. He needs YOU to help him organize his closet.

1. Give any red clothing items the class "red."
2. Give any striped clothing items the class "striped." _Hint: you can give elements more than one class!_
3. In CSS create a rule to make the striped text have a line through it. _Hint: Use_ `text-decoration: line-through;`
4. Use classes to help Carlton finish organizing his closet!

**If you finish early:** Add pictures of the clothing items Carlton might want to wear.
