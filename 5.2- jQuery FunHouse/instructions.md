Welcome to the jQuery Funhouse! Use jQuery to add interactivity to this page.

1. Make the garage door image slide up & down when the garage door opener is clicked.
2. Make Pikachu fade in when the pokeball is clicked.
3. Make the lightbulb show & hide when the light switch is clicked.

### Done early?

- Add a second jQuery action to a click handler, so that 2+ actions occur when an image is clicked.
- Create your own fourth Funhouse exhibit.
