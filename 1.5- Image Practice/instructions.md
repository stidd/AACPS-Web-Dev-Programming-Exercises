1. Edit the HTML so that the heading and image are for _your_ favorite musician
2. Add two more musicians to the page (name and image)

### If you finish early:

- Make it so that each _image_ links to a video of one of the musicianâ€™s popular songs (clicking on the picture should take you to the video)
- Make it so that clicking the image opens the video **in a new tab** (you will need to Google this).
