Give all the subway lines the right color!

1. Start with the **green** line. Add the class `green` to the 5 and 6 trains in HTML.
2. Weâ€™ve already written the green class **selector** for you in CSS, so youâ€™ll just need to add the color rule to make the train lines turn green. Add the CSS rule to line 6 below the `.green{`.
3. Add the class **blue** to the A, C, and E trains in HTML.

  4.In CSS write the selector for the **blue** class, and add the color rule.

4. Continue with as many subway lines as you can!

Feel free to just use standard CSS colors like `red`, `green`, etc. But if you want to use the official subway line colors, you can find the hex codes [on the MTAâ€™s web site](http://web.mta.info/developers/resources/line_colors.htm).

## If you finish earlyâ€¦

If you're done early, give the subway lines an extra style boost and make them look like they do on the subway signs. Use this image as a guide:
