You are creating a new Social Club exclusive for AACPS students! But first, you must create a login form so only Code Nation students who know the username and password will be able to login...

1. Set the correct username and password in line 2 and 3 for the `correctUsername` and `correctPassword` variables.
2. Inside the click handlers you must use compound conditional statements to check for the following:
- If the username **AND** password is correct, display a success message in the div with the class `message`.
- If the username **OR** password is incorrect, display a message stating so in the div with the class `message`.
- If the username **OR** password fields are empty, display a message saying they should try entering something in the div with the class `message`.

#### Done early?

Create additional compound conditionals:

1. If the username is correct but the password is incorrect.
2. If the password is correct but the username is incorrect.
