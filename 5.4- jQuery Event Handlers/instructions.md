There are four rectangles on the page. Write event handlers to change the content and style based on the user's actions.

1. The top left rectangle: Write an event handler to change the text to "Thank you for clicking on me!" and the background color to green when the user clicks on the rectangle.
2. The top right rectangle: Write an event handler to change the text to "Thank you for double-clicking on me!" and the background color to blue when the user double-clicks on the rectangle.
3. The bottom left rectangle: Write an event handler to change the text to "Thank you for hovering on me!" and the background color to yellow when the user hovers their mouse over the box.
4. The bottom right rectangle: Write an event handler to change the text to "Thank you for visiting!" and the background color to white when the user's mouse enters the rectangle, and then to "Come again soon!" and the background color to red when the user's mouse leaves the rectangle.

**_Hint: You need 2 event handlers for this rectangle_**

### Done Early?

What other event handlers can you use? Google jQuery event handlers. Then, make a fifth box and apply a new event hander to it.
